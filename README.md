# Introduction

The development of UAV command and control technologies can be aided greatly through the use of simulation. The AMASE simulation (Aerospace Multi-agent Simulation Environment) aims to provide a basic simulation environment for the demonstration and testing of UAV control technologies. AMASE brings several vehicle motion, systems, and control models together to form a single, basic-fidelity model for UAV simulation. It is designed to allow for command and control of multiple UAVs using control algorithms within the simulation as well as external control via a network interface.

## Full UAV Mission-Level Simulation
AMASE is a simulation toolset for the analysis and demonstration of aircraft automation and autonomy. AMASE includes the necessary components to create scenarios, simulate aircraft with basic EO/IR cameras, and interact with control algorithms to command aircraft in a scenario. Graphical user interfaces allow AMASE users to evaluate the actions of one or more aircraft at runtime, and the data output feature saves scenario data for post-processing. An integrated network server allows clients to connect to AMASE and send/receive data. AMASE includes three main programs: the simulation, a data playback tool, and a scenario setup tool.

The AMASE simulation models 5-DOF (coordinated turning) flight dynamics with self-configured performance at a set of design points. AMASE UAVs feature an autopilot that manages coordinated turns, altitude hold, heading hold, vertical speed hold, speed hold (auto-throttle), maintain track in wind fields, loiters (Figure-Eight, Orbit (circular), Racetrack) and waypoint following. Additionally, AMASE UAVs can be equipped with gimbaled and fixed sensors and the simualtion performs footprint analysis for target detection and includes line-of-sight calculation for obscuration of sensors by terrain.

## Requirements

*OpenAMASE* is a Java program that will run on any system with an appropriate version of Java installed.

To build or modify *OpenAMASE*, the Java JDK 1.11 or higher is required. All external libraries that *OpenAMASE*
requires are included in the `lib` folder. For convenience, Netbeans project files are included to allow
developers a quick way to change and re-build *OpenAMASE*.

## Building OpenAMASE

run `ant jar` in `OpenAMASE\OpenAMASE`.

## Running *OpenAMASE*

*OpenAMASE* has multiple options and configurations. For details, see `AMASE Tutorial.pptx` and `AmaseQuickstart.pdf`. In-depth
documentation is provided in the `docs` directory.

To run *OpenAMASE* without building from source, the entire source must still be downloaded (due to dependancies on multiple
libraries). The release version of `OpenAMASE.jar` should then be placed in the `dist` directory.

## 3rd Party Licenses
AMASE uses several 3rd party libraries distributed under open source licenses. The binary libraries are included in the `lib` folder. The original source, data, and applicable license files can be found in the subfolders of `lib`.
